# iStar Extension for Machine Learning Requirements

This repository contains an extension of the **iStar** framework for capturing Machine Learning (ML) requirements, developed following the **PRISE methodology**. The project provides a comprehensive metamodel that bridges the gap between domain experts and ML developers, facilitating the translation of high-level requirements into specific ML implementations. This work is described in the paper:

"An extension of iStar for Machine Learning requirements by following the PRISE methodology"

Authors: Jose M. Barrera, Alejandro Reina-Reina, Ana Lavalle, Alejandro Mat√©, Juan Trujillo. Published in:  Computer Standards & Interfaces, 88, 103806 (2024) DOI: ([10.1007/s13042-022-01583-x](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920548923000879?ssrnid=4358075&dgcid=SSRN_redirect_SD))

## Key Features

- **Captures Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**: Includes support for ML-specific qualities like explainability, equity, and robustness.
- **Guided Requirements Capture**: Offers a questionnaire and predefined tables to aid in eliciting requirements and selecting suitable algorithms.
- **Applicability Across Domains**: Demonstrated through real-world case studies in industrial and healthcare contexts.

## System Requirements

To use or implement the metamodel, you will need the following tools and dependencies:
- [Eclipse Modeling Framework (ECORE)](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/).
- Basic knowledge of the iStar framework and PRISE methodology.
